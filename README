Notes: not finished

  The website I put together creates an organized and professional online presence of myself, which I did not previously have. The site shows that I have made a lot of progress in the course of this class. The site, rzinsmeister.com validates and meets all requirements listed for project 2. 

  When I started the course I had never written HTML or CSS, let alone thought about designing for mobile or using a grid. I believe I have learned those skills necessary to meet the requirements of the project and thereby shown my progress in the class. I think there is always more to learn about building web pages, but from project 1 to project 2 I was able to add new aspects to my webdesign. In project 2 I made sure there was a comprehensible design and created multiple pages that you could move between in a sensible way.

  I went for a simple design of my site because I wanted to be able to alter colors easily to give it a bit of a pop. I was trying to create a simple neutral base, with the idea that in the future, once I learn how to add more design, I could add various colors to contrast. I left the background primarily white, but did change the font to give the page a look of more space. I wanted the index page to be fairly clean with a different looking menu, because I do not have blog or additional content. I wanted the content I put up to have a purpose and to be organized, not just filling up space. With that in mind I created just four menu items that I thought would fit my needs. HOwever, the problem with my design is that if I were to add additional menu items i may need to redesign my page breaks and how my menu works. It was my first attempt at creating a design that would work at all levels, but it ended up being very size dependent on the menu. I had to choose menu titles that were short enough to fit evenly. 

  The website I created first off has a domain and is hosted, which I had never sorted out before. The pages are on 24px line height and a 978 width. The site also works for smaller screens and presents the information in clear and readible format no matter the screen size. 

  I had wanted to play more with style on the page and making it look more like my sketches, however, simply ran out of time to make that happen. I wanted to make sure the basics were solid and tried to limit my code. I did not want to be redundant in my CSS and wanted to organize my html in pages with tagging that would make sense. This took more time than I realized. I found out the my CSS for my resume was for the most part not useful any longer. Also, I wanted to find a way to make my mobile view work for multiple pages and not have to write two sets of CSS for each page. This was really a challenge, because especially for my resume I didn't always want my headings to match on other pages. My inital CSS was not on the grid so I had to start over. I found that it was easier to be consistent with those headings outside of my resume.
