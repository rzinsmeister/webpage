  <h1 class="portfolio">Research on Enrollment in After School Programming</h1>

  <h2 class="portfolio_title">Conducted 2009-2010 as a VISTA</h2>

  <p class="photo_information">The data was collected during the 2008 - 2009 school year. The data is divided by the three sessions of after school and the schools that participated are not named.</p>
  
  <div id="afterschool_description">
  <h3>Explanation of Report</h3>
  <p>Each after school program collected their own attendance data for the entire school year. The programs ran for three sessions each, however, the number of days in each program varies slightly among schools. As a VISTA I took this data that was collected by the after school programs and summarized it in reports that are shown below. Despite variances among the sites the report applied the same standards to each site so that the schools were comparable.</p> 
  <p>The reports examine how homeless students attendance in after school compared to other student's attendance. The goal of the project was to assess access for homeless students to after school, their level of participation in after school and if it had any affect on their grades in school. This report only explains the first two aspects of the project and the last portion was going to be explored in the second year of research. The report was created and designed by me for the first portion of the research, from raw attendance data. The data submitted by the school sites was a daily attendance record. In order to analyze the data I created parameters for enrollment, participation, and attendance in order to discuss the differences among students who were active or inactive in after school. Since the ultimate goal was to look at whether participation in after school would help students with their grades in school, the first portion of the research needed to have a way to tell whether students were participating or not participating in after school. This is only a sample of the reports, I did not disclose the school or all the sites in interest of the school district.</p> 
  <h3>Enrollment</h3>  
  <p>Students were considered enrolled in after school if they attended on day of after school programming.</p>
  <h3>Participation</h3>
  <p>Students were recorded as participating if they attended five or more days.</p>
  <h3>Attendance</h3>
  <p>The rate of attendance is the number of those students who participated out of all those students that had enrolled. The percent of students who are counted as attending, because if they came less than five days there weren't participating and weren't getting the full benefits of after school programming.
