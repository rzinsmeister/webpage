    <p>
Originally from Wisconsin, I attended the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. I received my Bachelors of Arts with majors in German and Global studies and minors in Mass Communication and Teaching English as a Second Language.   
    </p>
    <p>
After graduation from university, I went abroad to teach English in Austria. I taught in two schools outside of Vienna at a tourism school in Semmering and a fifth-twelfth grade school in Neunkirchen. I taught there for one year and returned to the United States to do AmeriCorps.
    </p>
    <p>
I served two years with AmeriCorps in public education. My first year I spent with Minneapolis Public Schools working with the Homeless and Highly Mobile Student Services Department where I served primarily as a research assistant. The second year I served with City Year Chicago working in an eighth grade English classroom on the south side of Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
Currently, I am pursuing a Masters of Science in Information Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology. I expect to graduate in Spring 2013.
