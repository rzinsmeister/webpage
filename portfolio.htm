  <h3>Explanation of Report</h3>
  <p>Each after school program collected their own attendance data for the entire school year. The programs ran for three sessions each, however, the number of days in each program varies slightly among schools. As a VISTA I took this data that was collected by the after school programs and summarized it in reports. The reports examine how homeless students attendance in after school compared to other student's attendance. The goal of the project was to assess access for homeless students to after school, their level of participation in after school and if it had any affect on their grades in school. This report only explains the first two aspects of the project and the second portion was going to explored in the second year of research.All of the report explained here was created and designed by me</p>
